# Employee Performance Tracker

A comprehensive employee performance management system that combines SQLite for structured data and MongoDB for flexible performance review documents.

## üéØ Project Overview

This system provides a complete solution for managing employees, projects, and performance reviews with the following key features:

- **Employee Management**: Add, update, and manage employee records
- **Project Management**: Create projects, assign employees, and track progress
- **Performance Reviews**: Flexible review system with role-specific fields
- **Reporting**: Generate detailed reports and analytics
- **Hybrid Database**: SQLite for structured data, MongoDB for flexible documents

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

- **MongoDB**: Stores flexible performance review documents
- **Hybrid Approach**: Links employee IDs between databases for seamless integration

### Key Components
- `main.py` - Main application entry point with CLI interface
- `employee_manager.py` - Employee CRUD operations and validation
- `project_manager.py` - Project management and employee assignments
- `performance_reviewer.py` - Performance review system with flexible document structure
- `reports.py` - Reporting and analytics functions
- `database_connections.py` - Database connection management

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- MongoDB Atlas account (free)
- Git (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   cd employee_performance_tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up MongoDB** (see MongoDB Setup section below)

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üóÑÔ∏è MongoDB Setup

### Option A: MongoDB Atlas (Recommended)

MongoDB Atlas provides a free cloud-hosted MongoDB service that's perfect for development and small applications.

#### Step 1: Create MongoDB Atlas Account
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a free cluster (M0 Sandbox)

#### Step 2: Configure Network Access
1. In Atlas dashboard, go to "Network Access"
2. Add your IP address or use `0.0.0.0/0` for development (not recommended for production)
3. Click "Add Entry"

#### Step 3: Create Database User
1. Go to "Database Access"
2. Click "Add New Database User"
3. Choose "Password" authentication
4. Create username and password
5. Grant "Read and write to any database" permissions

#### Step 4: Get Connection String
1. In Atlas dashboard, click "Connect" on your cluster
2. Choose "Connect your application"
3. Select "Python" and version "3.6 or later"
4. Copy the connection string

#### Step 5: Configure Environment
Create or update the `.env` file in the project directory:

```env
# MongoDB Atlas Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGO_DB_NAME=performance_reviews_db
MONGO_COLLECTION_NAME=reviews

# SQLite Configuration
SQLITE_FILE=company.db
```

**Important**: Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual database user credentials, and update the cluster URL.

### Testing Your Setup

Run the setup script to verify everything is working:

```bash
python database_connections.py
```

You should see:
```
===  ===
[INFO] SQLite tables ready
[INFO] MongoDB collection ready: reviews

```

{
    "_id": ObjectId("..."),
    "review_id": 1,                    // Auto-incrementing integer
    "employee_id": 1,                   // Links to SQLite employee
    "review_date": "2024-01-15",
    "reviewer_name": "Sarah Manager",
    "overall_rating": 4.5,
    "strengths": "Excellent technical skills",
    "areas_for_improvement": "Time management",
    "comments": "Outstanding performance",
    "goals_for_next_period": "Complete AWS certification",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```
